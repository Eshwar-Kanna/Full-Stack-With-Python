 CRUD   :  create ,read ,  update , delete

 we should create a schema so that all the crud operations are managed by the database


 ORM  : Object oriented Mapper

 To integrate the code to the Database we need to use a library . here we use Flask_SQLAlchemy

 we set one primary_key (unique_id) to retrieve  the data when required


 we can download the sqlite Browser to see the format how the data is storing in database
