pip3 install flask

install the extension that the VSC prompt to install for python files


Flask is a frame work 

Route is the path to which a particular function return  the response

flask run command is used  to run the code but the changes made in the code after the server started will not be auto detected in which the server should be restart

to auto detect the changes and update in the server page we use app run in the code and specifying a port number 

    and the code runs with  python app.py

    we use return to send the data to server  and print for sending to console


Ctrl + U   is the shortcut for the source code of server page

flask can render the files only from the templates folder 

to render any file as response to any particular route  create a folder named templates and create the file inside it

render_tempalte is imported from the flask and used to send a file as response
