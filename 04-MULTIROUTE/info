

we include app.run()  in the code to run flask by python  app.py  instead  flask run

in the run function we can specify the port number and debug status either True or False 

Using GET method cannot secure the sensitive data it display the value in the url

To hide sensitive data we use post method 

GET  send the data in the url and post send data to header

in post method we use form to read data from server page instead args

we have multiple http verbs create -> post   ;  Read -> get   ;  update -> put   ; delete ->  delete

route function  have a capability  of creating  a dynamic variable and pass value from the subroute

if we use post then the both files should be used post
